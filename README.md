Keygen for Pixel Editor 2.36
============================

I happened to need to use this software for editing some small bitmap images due to poor performance of mspaint on Windows 7.
So I wrote a key generator to evaluate this software. So far, I have not find any bugs.
The key generating algorithm is simple. For evaluation only.

You can use Dev-cpp to compile the project.
